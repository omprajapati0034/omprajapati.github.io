I'm an Account Executive with 6+ years of consistent quota overachievement across AI/ML and finance automation platforms. I'm passionate about leveraging strategic technology to solve complex business challenges and drive measurable outcomes for customers. My work centers on building self-sourced pipelines, orchestrating complex, multi-threaded deals, and helping organizations scale through thoughtful technology adoption.

Trained in Winning by Design and fluent in MEDDIC and the Challenger Sale, I take pride in self-sourcing pipeline through high-impact cold outbound and deep, persona-driven prospecting. At Tipalti, I sourced the majority of my pipeline by picking up the phone, breaking into net-new accounts, and later accelerating deals through partner-led co-selling. I led multi-threaded discovery across Finance, Procurement, and IT, building tailored ROI business cases mapped to stakeholder metrics and strategic outcomes.

Known for bringing an AI-native mindset to sales, I integrate intelligent workflows across planning, outreach, and enablement—while staying relentlessly customer-obsessed. My approach is analytical and creative, grounded in a deep understanding of how and why high-growth companies buy, implement, and scale data-driven solutions.

I'm currently focused on continuing my growth trajectory—from midmarket into enterprise—eager to take on larger-scale, strategic deals that challenge me to deliver even greater impact.
