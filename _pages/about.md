I'm an enterprise Account Executive with 6+ years of consistent quota overachievement across AI/ML and finance automation platforms. My work centers on building pipeline autonomously, orchestrating complex, multi-threaded deals, and driving measurable business outcomes through strategic technology adoption.

Trained in Winning by Design and fluent in MEDDIC and Challenger methodologies, I specialize in breaking into enterprise accounts through high-quality outbound, alliance-driven co-selling, and deep discovery across stakeholder groups. At Tipalti, I consistently self-sourced over 100% of my pipeline, executing partner-led motions, conducting off-cycle stakeholder calls, and building tailored ROI business cases aligned to Finance, IT, and Procurement metrics.

I leverage AI extensively across my sales motionâ€”from territory planning and outbound automation to building scalable training on AI for prospecting adopted across sales teams. My approach is analytical, creative, and grounded in a deep understanding of how high-growth companies buy and deploy data-driven solutions.
